# Kiln

Kiln is a relational database implemented in Rust. Unlike databases like PostgreSQL and SQLite, Kiln does not operate on a client-server model. Instead, it is a stand-alone library that allows it to be used with zero runtime dependencies. 

This is a very early version of the database. So far the only thing done is the format the database stores tables.
